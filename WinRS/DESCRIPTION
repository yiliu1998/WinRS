Description: The package implements the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) for win ratio
    for two hierarchical endpoints in randomized clinical trials. The first endpoint is a survival endpoint
    subject to right-censoring, whereas the second endpoint is a non-survival endpoint (e.g., a continuous 
    quality-of-life or response outcome, measured only once during the study period) subject to missingness. 
    The covariate adjustment option in the package can adjust for missingness pattern for the second endpoint
    using a logistic regression based on the input covariates.
